# DEV_STATE.md - where we are (updated 2026-09-22 ~11:10 by Kimi)

## One-line status
ECHO-FREE PIPELINE SHIPPED (this commit): the overlay is now excluded from
capture via WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE -> DDA sees the TRUE desktop through the
overlay. Root-causes killed at once: wrong colors (feedback equilibrium is
gone), windows hidden behind the overlay (they are captured + presented),
blue-tint/drift class (no accumulate loop in the default path). Freeze class
addressed: bounded swapchain acquire (no more UINT64_MAX parks), hotkey drain
after every present, present pacing cap (--pace-ms, default 66 = <=15 fps).

OWNER: re-test with Desktop\RUN-DEMO.cmd. Expected: normal colors everywhere
(not just Task Manager), windows visible, no freezes; enhancement is SUBTLE
(mean|d| ~0.2/255 on the static wallpaper - see "quality ceiling" below).
Hotkeys: CTRL+ALT+X hide/show, CTRL+ALT+Q quit (now responsive).

## What changed this session (2026-09-22 10:10-11:10)
1. REPRO (owner scenario): notepad opened behind the overlay was invisible
   (Layer A confirmed 3rd time); during motion the loop processed ~1 Hz while
   DDA delivered 140 fps; every frame blocked ~240 ms in submit+present+fence.
2. FREEZE FIXES (main.cpp):
   - swapchain acquire: UINT64_MAX -> 50 ms tries x4 with drainHotkeys()
     between; on persistent NOT_READY the frame is SKIPPED, thread never parks.
   - drainHotkeys() after every present+fence wait.
   - present pacing --pace-ms (default 66): max ~15 processed fps, GPU idle
     between frames -> DWM keeps composition headroom.
3. INPUT CONTRACT (Layer 2a): features.comp channels 0-2 are now the REAL
   vendor deterministic_noise() (uint32-exact port of
   work/mlx-dlss/python/mlxdlss/features.py:87; transcendentals fp32, result
   half-rounded). The old integer-hash stand-in is gone. Also fixed silently:
   shaders/publish.glsl half_round is a NO-OP on this Arc driver (packHalf2x16
   folding) - features.comp/temporal.comp now use a local manual bit-exact
   halfr() (same code as m8/publish.glsl).
4. TEMPORAL PATH (Layer 2b, --temporal 0|1, DEFAULT OFF): features 7-9 carry
   real history from a new bufHist slot; new temporal.comp implements vendor
   compose_temporal (predicted + alpha*(history-predicted), BLEND_SCALE
   0.73974609375) at token res, with per-row zero-mean residual (B1 lesson).
   ON HOLD: at the event-driven ~1 Hz cadence history blending GHOSTS moving
   windows and the stronger residual re-showed row lines (owner screenshots
   10:55). Revisit only with realtime cadence (per-window game mode).
5. ECHO-FREE (the fundamental one): SetWindowDisplayAffinity(hwnd, 0x11).
   When active (default; --echo-free 0 for legacy): fbcancel skipped, decode
   feeds the raw capture, compose/encode run ABSOLUTE (no accumulate), no
   lastPresented mirror. fbmean stays 0.00 by design. Verified: notepad opened
   behind the overlay appears in the PRESENTED frame (out\m8b_frame_30.bmp),
   colors faithful, mean|d| 0.20/255, verify ALL PASS, gpu/frame 66 ms.

## Quality ceiling (honest, open)
The chain runs at a PINNED 12x24 = 288-token grid for ANY content: a 2560x1440
desktop is downscaled to 24x12 (~107 px/token) before the network sees it.
That is far off the vendor's operating point, so the residual is low-frequency
tone junk, not detail: measured head DC -0.7..-1.3 (design expects |mean|<0.02)
which is WHY the per-row DC calibration exists, and why "enhancement" is
invisible on static content. This is the owner's "no DLSS5 improvement visible"
- it is a DESIGN ceiling, not a bug in this pipeline. The real fix is the
per-window mode (WGC capture of a game/video window at render-like resolution
-> adequate token density) per docs\windows-port-plan.md sec.1 + NeuralScreen's
OpenWgc pattern. THAT is the next milestone (Layer 1 proper).

## Numbers (current build, echo-free default)
- Chain ~50-56 ms/frame, e2e ~59 ms, gpu (submit+present+fence) ~66 ms (was
  ~240 ms in the feedback build).
- Verify: --novideo 31 frames ALL PASS (temporal 0 and 1); video 35 frames
  ALL PASS with a window opened mid-run.
- New CLI: --pace-ms N (66), --temporal 0|1 (0), --echo-free 0|1 (1).

## Batch files (desktop + tools\ are in sync now)
- RUN-DEMO.cmd: m8blive --frames 1000000 (all defaults; honest wall text).
- RUN-DEMO-CALM.cmd: + --wiggle-idle 30.
- RUN-DEMO-M4.cmd: legacy stand-in transport demo (unchanged, historical).

## Next steps (order)
1. OWNER RE-TEST: RUN-DEMO.cmd - colors, window visibility, freeze behavior.
2. WGC per-window mode (the owner's core ask: games/video at proper token
   density, overlay limited to the target window rect). Big rock.
3. If owner wants a STRONGER visible effect on the desktop meanwhile:
   --strength 1.5-2.0 (safe: hpfilter+resgate still active).
4. Perf fusion (cosine_v et al.) for a 30 fps path; M5 zero-copy backlog.
5. temporal re-enable experiment ONLY at realtime cadence (after #2).

## Watch items carried over
- LUIDs are per-boot; never hardcode (95a2 -> 9a8b -> 968b observed).
- VS Setup.Configuration COM discovery still broken; build.cmd NMake fallback
  works (used for this commit's builds).
- GDI screenshots cannot see the overlay; DDA now CANNOT see it either (by
  design, WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE). Ground truth of the PRESENTED frame =
  verify readbacks out\m8b_frame_{10,30,60}.bmp; ground truth of the DESKTOP =
  m1dda snapshots.
- --wiggle-idle re-arm suspect (DEV_STATE history) - untested this session.
